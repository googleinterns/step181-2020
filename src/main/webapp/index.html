    <br />
    <p>
      ZoomTube is a web application that facilitates the viewing of recorded university lectures. With classes shifting
      towards a virtual environment, lectures have become disengaging, especially for those watching asynchsronously.
      Our web application aims to mitigate this issue by providing a way for students to interact with each other on a
      single platform.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Recorded university lectures are synchronized with their transcript and a student discussion forum. Students are
      able to create and view timestamp annotations as a lecture is playing. These annotations can include comments,
      questions, and replies. Students watching can easily refer to relevant comments made by other students, add their
      own, and reply to other studentsâ€™ questions.
